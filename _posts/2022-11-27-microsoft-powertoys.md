[Microsoft PowerToys](https://aka.ms/getPowertoys) is a collection of very handy utilities for Windows, where "very handy" means "Grrr why don't these come with Windows by default?". 

These are some of my favourite PowerToys: 

- [Image Resizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/image-resizer): Via a right click in File Explorer.
- [PowerRename](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/powerrename): Easy batch file renaming, again via a right click in File Explorer. 
- [Color Picker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker): Like Digital Colour Meter on MacOS
- [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run): app launcher like Spotlight on MacOS

Highly recommended.
