[Microsoft PowerToys](https://aka.ms/getPowertoys) is a collection of supremely handy utilities for Windows, where "supremely handy" means "baffling why they don't come with Windows by default". 

These are some of my favourite PowerToys: 

- [Image Resizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/image-resizer): Supremely handy!
- [PowerRename](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/powerrename): rename files easily. Life-changing! 
- [Color Picker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker): like Digital Colour Meter on MacOS
- [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run): app launcher like Spotlight on MacOS

Microsoft says these are ["utilities to customize Windows"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/). I would suggest they are utilities to ameliorate suffering.
