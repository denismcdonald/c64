[Microsoft PowerToys](https://aka.ms/getPowertoys) is a collection of super handy utilities for Windows, where "super handy" means "Why don't these come with Windows by default?". 

These are some of my favourite PowerToys: 

-[Image Resizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/image-resizer): Via a right click in File Explorer.

-[PowerRename](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/powerrename): Easy file renaming via File Explorer. 

-[Color Picker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker): Like Digital Colour Meter on MacOS

-[Keyboard Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager): Create your own system-wide shortcuts; eg, for volume and media playback on keyboards that lack dedicated buttons.
