First post!

And first tech tip:  many public libraries provide access to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) for free, and some of these libraries can be joined online.  For example:

- In Victoria: [Yarra Plenty Regional Library](https://www.yprl.vic.gov.au/)
- In South Australia: [Libraries SA](https://www.libraries.sa.gov.au/custom/web/selfreg.html)
- In New South Wales: [Wollongong City Libraries](https://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/library)
- In Queensland: [State Library](https://www.slq.qld.gov.au)

No such luck, though (as best I can tell), if you're in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory.
