First tech tip: Many public libraries provide access to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) for free, and some of these libraries can be joined online.  For example, in Australia:

- Victoria: [Yarra Plenty Regional Library](https://www.yprl.vic.gov.au/)
- South Australia: [Libraries SA](https://www.libraries.sa.gov.au/custom/web/selfreg.html)
- New South Wales: [Wollongong City Libraries](https://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/library)
- Queensland: [State Library](https://www.slq.qld.gov.au)

A downside is that you don't get certificates with your name on them.

Still, a saving of AUD$50 per month.
